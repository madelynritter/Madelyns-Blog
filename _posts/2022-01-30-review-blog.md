**SUMMARY**

Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan, 1915-1940 (MSKKK) is an interactive map of the United States that shows the growth of the Ku Klux Klan throughout the early twentieth century. The points on the map signify Klaverns, which are local groups of the Klan. The map of this project is meant to show that unlike other waves of popularity of the Klan, this particular one was spread evenly throughout the United States instead of just in the Deep South. The project directors’ intended aim for this project is for users to educate themselves on their local Klaverns and do further reading into those who opposed the Klan’s acts.

**DESIGN**

This website uses a Google Map of the United States that can be zoomed in or out depending on the user’s scope of interest. The red dots on the map serve as the main focal point and interactive element of the project; this makes the site more accessible on a laptop or computer, as it is easier to click on each individual dot. The slider located at the bottom of the page allows for the user to time travel through the years of 1915-1940 to see how widespread the Ku Klux Klan became throughout the times. The user can either pick a date to view, or watch the time lapse version of it by pressing the play button.

**RELEVANCE**

The directors of MSKKK have combined interactive elements with historical information to give the user a deeper understanding of the topic at hand. The main director of the project is a professor of history at Virginia Commonwealth University, so he is to be trusted when giving information on this historical topic. The project even offers contact information so that if the user has something to contribute, such as information or questions, they are able to contact the creators. This gives the user power and ability to interact with the project beyond what is on the website. MSKKK encourages further research into the topic, as there is so much left unsaid.

**FINDINGS**

Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan, 1915-1940 uses mapping technology to merge historical data with interactive elements that provide for a very educational experience for the user. I personally enjoyed clicking on dots throughout the country to see which Klaverns were established at different points in time and reading the supplemental information under the “Learn More” tab. I believe this project could be improved by adding instructions for how to work the zoom in/out feature and progress the data from 1915 to 1940, as this could be unclear to some viewers. In addition, the user has to do some work to find the supplemental research on the site; placing the “Learn More” tab on the front page would eliminate this issue and cause more people to click on it.

In addition, the links on the map are geographically accurate and are able to provide some information, but do not provide any research or historical information on the particular Klavern; instead, it just states when and where it was created and makes the user do their research to find out more about them. If the information was present when the user clicked on the dots, this would lead to an easier educational experience because of the readily accessible information.

I was able to enjoy this project because I have access to a computer; a main issue that I found while studying this project was that it does not work at all on mobile devices. The viewer is able to read the supplemental research, but the interactive map is unusable. This is an issue of accessibility, so I would like to see the creators of this project expand it to a mobile friendly site.

Overall, this project is very well done and should be commended for its’ merge of historical research and technology to educate users on something that they might not have thought about before. It also advocates for minority groups by highlighting the rebellion to the Klan in the research portion of the site; this is a digital humanities project that does a great job of teaching about a very dark time in history.
