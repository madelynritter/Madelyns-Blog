### **SUMMARY**
*Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan, 1915-1940* (MSKKK) is an interactive map of the United States that shows the growth of the Ku Klux Klan throughout the early twentieth century. The red points on the map signify Klaverns, which are local groups of the Klan. Unlike other waves of popularity of the Klan that were concentrated in the Deep South, this one spread evenly throughout the United States . The project directors’ intended aim for this project is for users to educate themselves on their local Klaverns and do further reading into those who opposed the Klan’s acts.

### **DESIGN**
MSKK uses a Google Map of the United States that the user zooms in or out of depending on their scope of interest. The red dots on the map serve as the main focal point and interactive element of the project. This makes the site more accessible on a laptop or computer, as it is easier to click on each individual dot with a mouse rather than a finger. The slider at the bottom of the page lets the user to time travel through the years of 1915-1940. This visualizes how widespread the Ku Klux Klan became throughout the times. The user can either pick a specific year to view or watch the time lapsed version by pressing the play button.

### **RELEVANCE**
The directors of MSKKK combine interactive elements with historical information to give the user a deeper understanding of the topic at hand. The main director of the project, John Kneebone, is a professor of history at Virginia Commonwealth University. This makes him trustworthy when giving information on this historical topic. The project even offers contact information so that if the user has information or questions, they are able to contact the creators. This gives the user power and ability to interact with the project beyond what is on the website. MSKKK encourages further research into the topic, as there is so much left to discover.

### **FINDINGS**
*Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan* merges interactive mapping technology and historical data that provide for a very educational experience for the user. I personally enjoyed clicking on dots in my area to see which Klaverns were established in the places I grew up.

The red dots on the map are geographically accurate and are able to provide some information, but do not provide any further research or information on the particular Klavern.  Instead, they just state when and where the Klavern was created, which makes the user do their own research to find out more about them. If the information was readily available when the user clicked on the dots, it would lead to an easier educational experience.

I believe this project could be improved by adding instructions for how to work the zoom in/out feature to progress the data from 1915 to 1940, as this could be unclear to some viewers. The user also has to do some searching to find the supplemental research on the site. Placing the “Learn More” tab on the front page would eliminate this issue and motivate more people to click on it.

A main issue that I found while studying this project was that it does not work at all on mobile devices. The viewer is able to read the supplemental research, but the interactive map is unusable. Instead, an automated gif of the map comes up, which is pictured below. I was able to enjoy this project because I have access to a computer, but this is not the case for everyone. This is an accessibility issue, so I would like to see the creators of this project expand it to a mobile friendly platform so that everyone can enjoy it.

Overall, this project is very well done; MSKKK should be commended for its’ merge of historical research and technology to educate users on something that they might not have thought about before. It also advocates for minority groups by highlighting minority groups on the research portion of the site. This is a digital humanities project that does a great job of teaching about a very dark time in history.
