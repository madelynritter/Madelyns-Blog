My name is Madelyn Ritter and I am a sophomore at Christopher Newport University. I go by the pronouns she/her/hers. I am a Communication Studies major with double minors in Leadership Studies and Digital Humanities. I am taking ENGL 350: Writing for the Digital Humanities as an elective for the DH minor in addition to fulfilling a writing intensive requirement for my degree. I have been very interested in DH since I took the intro course last semester. I enjoy being able to fulfill my longing for creativity while designing projects that will educate the public and make the world a better place. I hope to become a better writer through this course and strengthen my ability to create Digital Humanities projects.
