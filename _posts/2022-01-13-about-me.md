# About Me

![profile picture](https://madelynritter.github.io/madelyns-blog/images/profile.jpg)

My name is Madelyn Ritter and I am a sophomore at Christopher Newport University. I go by the pronouns she/her/hers. I am a Communication Studies major with double minors in Leadership Studies and Digital Humanities. I am taking ENGL 350: Writing for the Digital Humanities as an elective for the DH minor in addition to fulfilling a writing intensive requirement for my degree. I have been very interested in DH since I took the intro course last semester. I enjoy being able to fulfill my longing for creativity while designing projects that will educate the public and make the world a better place. I hope to become a better writer through this course and strengthen my ability to create Digital Humanities projects.


After graduation, I want to enter the field of social media marketing, hopefully in the entertainment industry. My dream job is to work at [Spotify]( https://open.spotify.com/user/madelynn_66?si=22cb1ea8a89b4528) in New York City, as music has always been important to me and New York is my favorite place in the world. I hope that this class will help me achieve my dreams by teaching me how to make my writing **eye-catching** through coding so that my work stands out among the rest.

I am in the President's Leadership Program at CNU, which means I am required to volunteer at least one hundred hours prior to graduation. Because of this, I have volunteered in numerous places around the Newport News Community and have developed a passion for serving my city. I am also A Front Desk Assistant at the Office of Residence Life, so you may see me if you ever stop by York River Hall! Academics wise, I have been on the Dean's List **all three** semesters I have been at CNU, so I definitely take time to devote myself to my studies. I am also a part of WCNU Radio and I hope to host my own radio show during this semester!

In my personal life, I am from Chesapeake, Virginia, which is only about fifty minutes away from CNU. I am a major theater kid and I participated in musical theatre and choir all throughout high school. My favorite music artist is Harry Styles, who I've seen in concert six times (including with One Direction). **_Ask me about him. Seriously. I could do it all day._** In my free time, I love watching TikTok (mainly [Scout and Violet](https://www.tiktok.com/@maiaknight?lang=en)) and working as a server in a movie theater when I'm home during school breaks.
